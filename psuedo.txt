I need to show the user a welcome screen

should have a navbar with link to highscore page

when they click the start button

show first question and start timer

when they answer the question we subtract 15 seconds if they are wrong 

display next question

add new row that represents end game screen

div to show there score hint score secondsLeft

this row should start with class of "d-none"

you will remove the class "d-none" when the clock is at 0 or if they finish the questions.
